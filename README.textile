h2. Introduction

Ico is a JavaScript graph library that uses "Raphael":http://raphaeljs.com/ to draw.  This means it can draw charts in multiple browsers.

The current version is a basic implementation to test out the feasibility of the concept.

h3. Targeted graph types

* Sparklines
* Line graphs
* Bar graphs

h3. Design considerations and goals

* Clarity: Use of white-space to help lend clarity to graphs, nominal scale vs. ordinal scale
* Simplicity: Minimal use of decorations and lines, reliance on the Gestalt principle of closure
* Conciseness: Avoidance of graph types that don't efficiently present data (pie charts, radar maps)

These goals are based on recommendations in Stephen Few's books:

* Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten
* Information Dashboard Design

Which was generally in turn based on Edward Tufte's work.

h3. Todo

* IE bugs: text alignment for none centre labels (Raphael/VML issue), sparklines aren't inline
* Label wrapping
* Wrap wide label text in boxes
* Determine library structure
* Humanize labels: rather than showing 1,000,000 optionally show "1m"

h2. Examples

See index.html for current API usage.  This will change as I evolve the API to support the targeted graph types.

h2. Requirements

* "Prototype":http://prototypejs.org
* "Raphael":http://raphaeljs.com

h2. Library style

I've added semicolons to line endings to make compressing/obscuring the library easier (if you do that sort of thing).
