h2. Introduction

Ico is a JavaScript graph library that uses "Raphael":http://raphaeljs.com/ to draw.  This means it can draw charts in multiple browsers.

The current version is a basic implementation to test out the feasibility of the concept.

h3. Targeted graph types

* Sparklines
* Line graphs
* Bar charts

h2. Examples

See index.html for current API usage.  This will change as I evolve the API to support the targeted graph types.

h2. Requirements

* "Prototype":http://prototypejs.org
* "Raphael":http://raphaeljs.com

h2. Library style

I've added semicolons to line endings to make compressing/obscuring the library easier (if you do that sort of thing).
